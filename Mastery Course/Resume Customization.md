### 🧠 1. **FAANG / MANG Companies**

| Must Have                  | Tips                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Use Numbers                | e.g., “Reduced API latency by 45%”                  |
| Use System Design Keywords | Microservices, Scaling, Load balancing              |
| Mention Impact             | “Handled 5M+ concurrent users”                      |
| STAR Format                | Each bullet must show context + solution + impact   |
| Use Leetcode/GitHub links  | Optional but useful                                 |
| Keywords                   | Data Structures, Algorithms, Big O, Design Patterns |

**Example FAANG bullet:**

### 🧠 2. **MNC (TCS, Infosys, Capgemini, Cognizant)**

> **Goal:** Process, adaptability, tech exposure.

| Must Have               | Tips                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Include Agile/Scrum     | e.g., “Participated in daily scrum meetings” |
| Highlight Tech Stack    | Tools like JIRA, Confluence, Jenkins         |
| Emphasize adaptability  | “Worked in both .NET and Java stack”         |
| Use Global/Client terms | “Served US-based banking client”             |

**Example MNC bullet:**

### 🧠 3. **Startups**

> **Goal:** Versatility, ownership, speed.

## 🧑‍💼 **PHASE 3: Multi-Designation Resume Handling**

### Scenario:

You’re applying as a **Frontend Developer**, **Full Stack**, and **System Architect** — all different.

### 🔄 Solution:

**Use a Master Resume + Job-Specific Copies**

1. **Master Resume:** Contains **everything** (all experience, tech stack, all roles).
2. **Clones per Job:** Tailor each one like this:

   * **Frontend Job:** Push React, CSS, UI/UX, Web Vitals
   * **Backend Job:** Push C#, API, SQL, architecture
   * **Full Stack Job:** Balance both with real impact bullets
   * **Data Role:** Push data transformation, SQL, ETL, analysis

> **Always rename job titles in summary:**
> `Summary: Full Stack Developer (3 Yrs) | React, .NET Core, SQL | Built scalable SaaS apps`

---

## 🧠 **PHASE 4: ATS Optimization Mastery (99.9% Score)**

### ✅ What is ATS?

> Applicant Tracking System — filters resumes based on keywords.

### 🚫 Common Mistakes:

* PDF with graphics/icons (not parseable)
* Fancy templates with 2–3 columns
* Using synonyms not matching the JD

---

### ✅ Do This Instead:

| Feature   | Tip                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Format    | Use clean, single-column format           |
| Keywords  | Extract from JD using tools like Jobscan  |
| Font      | Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman (10–12pt) |
| File Type | PDF (if allowed), else .docx              |
| Avoid     | Tables, Headers/Footers, Icons            |
